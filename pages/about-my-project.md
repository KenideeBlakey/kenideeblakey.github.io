subtitle: Skin cancer detection
project_title: "Trustworthy Multimodel AI for Skin Cancer Detection"

problem: |
  Our problem is that early skin cancer detection for melanated people is a challenge in healthcare. This is due to diagnostic biases, and limited access to skin care resources like a dermatologist. Dermatology AI tools that have been used for decades lack fairness and generaliziblity across diverse populations. 

approach: |
  The project follows 2 month period:

  - Conducting literature review on skin cancer 
  - Learning about existing AI machines and its approaches 
  - Practicing data sets and anaylisis 
  - Performing basic exploratory data analysis 

  Literature review tasks, Python tutorial tasks, Dataset and data analysis, Models and writing resources will all be used to ensure we have thorough information

outcome: |
  TBD
