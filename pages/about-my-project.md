subtitle: Skin cancer detection
project_title: "Trustworthy Multimodel AI for Skin Cancer Detection"

problem: |
  Our problem is that early skin cancer detection for melanated people is a challenge in healthcare. This is due to diagnostic biases, and limited access to skin care resources like a dermatologist. Dermatology AI tools that have been used for decades lack fairness and generaliziblity across diverse populations. Due to this issue we aim to develop an improved model that detects skin cancer across all ranges of skin tone. We also will be able to explain how the model works to clinicians and patients.

approach: |
  The project follows 2 month period:

  - Conducting literature review on skin cancer 
  - Learning about existing AI machines and its approaches 
  - Practicing data sets and anaylisis 
  - Performing basic exploratory data analysis 

  Literature review tasks, Python tutorial tasks, Dataset and data analysis, Models and writing resources will all be used to ensure we have thorough information. We are here to develop an imporved model that can accurately and without bias detect skin cancer across wide ranges of skin color.
