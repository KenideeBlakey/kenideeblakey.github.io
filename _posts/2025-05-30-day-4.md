what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about a new functions, booleans. It is mainly used for conditions and has a true or false data type. This was very new to me but I was able to grasp the concept. We also learned about the evolution of generative ai which was cool because it is used so much in our technology today. Lastly, I learned how to differeniate between real photos and Ai photos. 

blockers: |
  Blockers came from the project. I know many concepts but I think when putting them all together it was taking me a while to remember all the information we have been learning. I think with more practice I will be more quick when it comes to explain and putting all concepts together.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, I enjoyed the last day of bootcamp. I learned so much this week and surprised myself when it came to catching on. The best part of today was playing around with different ai programs. The class was super interactive and I got to play around with how ai interprets music which was fun. Lastly, I loved the guess bot actvity, very interactive and some images fooled me.
