what_i_learned: |
    Today was our first day learning PANDAS & basecode. We started the day off on W3 schools tutorials going over PANDAS and learning our base code for detection. After  break we came back and started applying the information we learned from the tutorial videos. We also starting looking our first data set of skin lesion images. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was very graphic. Being that I've worked in the hospital before it wasn't super new to me but overall our group were pretty shocked by the images. We also got a pop in from Dr.Pramnanik which was cool.  
blockers: |
  Main blockers today was applying the basecode in google colab. Being that it is a new set of code and data it was a bit of a learning block. Despite the block, I think it pretty cool to insert all the data and come out with graphs and sets.

reflection: |
  Today was a bit of a learning curve but I know with more practice I'll get the hang of it. The new code and data sets are defintely intimidating but Blessing does a great job at walking us through everything. This week I would love to learn more about the different lesions so I will be able to identify the types of cancer when I see it. This will be helpful to the project but also helpful for me and my career field.
