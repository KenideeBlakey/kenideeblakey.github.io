what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first day in person for CEAMLS. We kicked it off this morning meeting faculty, directors and graduate mentors. It took a minute for me to warm up to the new enviroment but after a while I got comfortable with talking. I am excited that this will be an interactive program. After meeting, we broke out into our groups for a fun challenge of building the tallest marshmellow tower. My group did not win but it was still fun to finally meet them in person and speak with other groups. I learned that my group will be fun, interactive and I feel we will work well together. After lunch, we went back to our labs where we started finding credible research papers for our experiment.

  no blockers today.

  I am interested to see how the rest of the week will go. So far so good, I am almost finished finding my papers. This portion was easy for me because I have prior research experience. Overall, I am excited to get to know my group members more throughout the week.
