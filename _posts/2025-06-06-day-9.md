what_i_learned: |
    Today was the end to our first week. We started off with putting together our powerpoints for the end of the week check ins. It was a fun little refresher of what I learned for the week. After we presented it on zoom, we started finding more literature review articles. This time I found more pretaining to my subgroup area which is models and dermoscopic images. After break, Blessing did an overview of all the machine learning models that we will be using for this research. We got a better understanding of everything. Lastly, we finished off the day with a kahoot testing out knowledge on python. Overall, I had a great week.

reflection: |
  This week was a good week for me. I am enjoying my research topic and my subgroup area. Also, I love that I understand the machine learning models that we will be using. Overall, Blessing is a really good mentor. She breaks things down very well. I am interested to see how next week will go because we are getting more into our subgroup areas. Stay tuned!
