what_i_learned: |
  This morning we started in breakout rooms meeting our research groups and mentors. I am excited to start next week in person because my group and project topic are interesting. After the break we learned about replit and python. The basic functions of python were easy to learn, replit was a little bit complicated at first.  

blockers: |
  My blockers came from replit, at first I couldn't figure out how to work the website. I feel overall I now have a better understanding of python and replit. The more I practice both systems, it will become easier to use.

reflection: |
  Overall I am happy to keep learning. Although it is a lot of information at one time, I think I am doing a decent job at keeping up. This is new turf for me so its taking some adjustments but our instructors are making the learning a bit smoother. My favorite part of todays class was playing headbands it was a great debrief moment for my brain.
