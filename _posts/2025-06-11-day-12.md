  Today we started the day with finding diverse datasets particularly those that used more dark skin tones. To my surprise, many data sets did not have a diverse selection. We managed to find a data sets from Stanford and PAD-UFES that had about 73 images of darker skin tones. After this we learned how to make rows and columns of each datasets in python which was cool because it is applying what we have been learning. Lastly, we finished up the day comparing both of our datasets and tomorrow we will be finding more.

  Overall, today was really fun because we are starting to put everything together. Our goal is to have the first model made by Friday. With the information we have been finding I think we can accomplish it. Also, we found a lot more literature reviews today so that help a lot in determining the data sets. I am interested to see how our first model will turn out.
