what_i_learned: |
    Today we started off the day with a tour of Morgan State University. Being that I am a previous student here, this was more of a social hour for me. Although it was hot, I was able to talk and get to know other members of the cohort, even those that aren't in my group project. After lunch, we went to our labs and we started it off with a kahoot. The questions were based on the python lesson we learned yesterday. I was happy that I did way better on the kahoot today than yesterday. It shows me that I am learning. Lastly, Blessing assigned us all a mini project with python. I found myself getting frustrated because I thought I knew most of the material but when it came time to apply it, I kept getting stuck. I am learning to be patient with myself through this process of python. 
blockers: |
  My main blocker today was my mini project. Also, it was very hot outside during the tour so I feel like after the break I was drained from the sun and it was hard for me to lock in.

reflection: |
  My main takeaways today are that I need more practice with python. I am feeling indifferent about my progress with it this week. I know being that I am a non major I can't expect to know everything in the first week. I am just the type of person that gets annoyed when I can't do things on my own lol. All in all I will continue practicing.
