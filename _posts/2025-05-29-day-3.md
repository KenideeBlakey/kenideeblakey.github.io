what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about computer vision, I/O cycles, type casting, and digital profile with variables. Computer vision has been my favorite workshop so far. I found it really cool how its used in so much of our everyday technology but I never knew the proper term for it. Also I enjoyed the workshop where we made our own computer vision.

blockers: |
  My main blockers today came from replit. It is an interesting website to navigate for me but I do feel as though I did better with it today than yesterday. The hardest part was building the wage calculator. 
  
reflection: |
  Overall, I am proud that I'm progressing. Seeing my progession is a great motivator for me to keep trying even though this is a new turf for me.
