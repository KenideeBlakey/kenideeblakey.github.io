what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued learning PANDAS and going over our basic code. We also learned how to insert images from a dataset in python which was cool. I am retaining more information about PANDAS which I am happy about. After lunch we played a kahoot to go over our knowledge about machine learning and PANDAS. I did really good on this kahoot and I am proud because it shows progression and retaining information.

reflection: |
  Overall, I’m really noticing that I’m understanding Pandas better, which feels like good progress. Learning how to insert images from a dataset in Python made the coding feel more practical and interesting. I am starting to feel more confident about topics and techniques we are learning which motivates me to keep going. Everyday we have learned something new which I enjoy. I am intrigued to see how the rest of the week will go.
