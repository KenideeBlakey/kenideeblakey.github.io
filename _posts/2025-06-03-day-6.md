what_i_learned: |
   Today was our first full day in the labs. We started off this morning with going over the basics of python. Our mentor Blessing wanted to see where everyone's skillset was at on python. She assigned us tutorials to go over, and before lunch we did some active recall. I learned many things I needed to refresh my memory on from python 101. We ended the day going over more modules and quizzes ourselves on the material.
blockers: |
  My main blocker was remembering some of the python material. Currently the hardest thing for me to remember is the differences between sets, lists and tuples.

reflection: |
  My main takeaway of today is that I will need to do some python studying on my own. I want to be able to build the best model possible so I have to be able to fully understand all concepts. As the week goes on I feel I will get better at retaining information, because we will continue active recall.
