what_i_learned: |
  Today we started off with continuing our code for our data sets. We separated them by malignant and benign, maligant being cancerous lesions and benign being non cancerous. We took a brief pause on coding to start our end of the week check ins. Our presentation went well and I hope we get good feedback from others in our cohort. Lastly, when we came back from lunch we finished up our code. I am excited about this because it means we will start building our models next week.

  Overall, I had a pretty productive week. I learned a lot about the syntax of PANDAS and our base code we will be using. It was really cool learning about the different types of cancerous and non cancerous lesions and also learning the proper terms for them. I hope to learn more about this through Dr.Pramanik next week as I feel it would help our project be more informative. I will enjoy my weekend after my productivity this week.
