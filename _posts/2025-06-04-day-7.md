what_i_learned: |
    Today was a very interactive day for my group. This morning we started it off with discussing our subgroups we wanted to be assigned to for our project. I picked analyzing the types of models and images that are being used for skin cancer detection. A couple of my group members had the same ideas so Blessing typed all of our subgroups in a spreadsheet so we can see the differences between everyones. I enjoyed this first session of the day because I learned about some of the different Ai models we will be building and I learned that we already have pre-data to use. After lunch we came back and had about an hour on our python models. Lastly to finish off the day we played a kahoot game to test the knowledge of everyone with what they learned today. Overall, today was really interactive and I learned a lot.

  No blockers today

reflection: |
  My main takeaways of today is that I prefer an interactive class. For the past few days Blessing has been trying to see out learning styles and how we all retain information. Yesterday we did a lot of independent work but today we had more of an interactive session to see what we all preferred. I preferred this session a lot more because I was able to have open dicussion with my group members and retain more information.
