  Today we started the day with our enrichment block. During this time we did team bonding and team building games. We played jenga and taboo. It was fun because it was very interactive and we won an hour off of our scheduled day. After the break we came back and labeled each our datasets and the images we are focusing on. Then, we learned how to merge our data which was interesting because we applied previous python methods.

  Overall, my favorite part of the day was the enrichment block. I would love to do more interactive games and I appreciated how we had the option to give suggestions on future activities. Our project is coming along well, I think we will most likely start moving into the model making on friday. We have a good set of data so I feel our project is off to a great start.
